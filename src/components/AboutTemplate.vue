    <p class="about">This is a Shapes Drawing App built with Vue 3. It allows users to select three arbitrary
        points within the boxed area and draws shapes based on those points. The shapes include a blue parallelogram and a
        yellow circle with the same area. Users can drag the points around, and the shapes and information will update
        accordingly. Users can also reset the board to select three new points.</p>
